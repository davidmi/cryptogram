First hacky version of the code is up. Live version running here:

To run the code yourself, I think you'll need a webserver because of file access control in Javascript. 
I have a very simple PHP proxy to get around the restriction.

One bug: I'm having trouble with base64 <-> hex conversions. Sometimes I end up with extra padding or 
lose one character and I'm not sure why. This will cause the decryption to choke.
