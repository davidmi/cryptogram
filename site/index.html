      <h2>About</h2>
      Cryptogram is software for password-protecting images to provide greater control over access to them.
      The applications takes regular JPEG images as input and produces images that look like random noise.
      With the correct password, the original images can be restored.
      The encoding format is designed to be robust to some level of JPEG compression.
      This means you can upload Cryptogram images to various social media services and the underlying
      encoded data should not be lost.

    <div class=info>
      <h2>Why</h2>
      What happens when users upload
      images to social media sites without a full understanding of the privacy settings? Images may be shared inappropriately
      with friends, acquaintances, or strangers. This project provides a way for people to take increased control over the privacy of personal images.
      Cryptogram offers password-level security inside JPEG itself. Encrypted images can be used in a variety of scenarios, including
      websites, social media, or e-mail. But in all cases, password protection is obtained that does not rely on the
      privacy settings or implementation of any particular service provider.

      We encourage anyone to try out the current release of Cryptogram.
      <p>1) Install the <a href="cryptogram.crx">Chrome Extension.</a></p>

      <p>2) Right-click this image and select <i>Decrypt Image.</i></p>

      <p>3) When asked for a password enter:&nbsp; <code>cryptogram</code></p>

      <p><img src=icon19.png style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 5px">
        After installation, you should see the Cryptogram icon on the right of your Chrome address bar. Click the icon to access settings.

      <h2>Technical</h2>

        <p>Image data is converted into base-64 which is then encrypted using AES block cipher, as
          implemented by <a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/" target=_new>SJCL</a>. The resulting
          encrypted base-64 data is written to a JPEG with a scheme that uses 2x2 pixel blocks to represent
          a base-8 number. Base-8 values are represented as shades in the luminance (Y) channel of the YCbCr
          colorspace. Cryptogram images can withstand JPEG compression down to approximately 70% quality before
          the decoder starts to fail. As JPEG quality decreases, eventually some base-8 values will become corrupted making decryption impossible.</p>

        <p>The code is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/prglab/cryptogram" target=_new>GitHub</a>.</p>
