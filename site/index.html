    <h2>About</h2>
    Cryptogram is software for password-protecting images to provide greater control over access to them.
    The applications takes regular JPEG images as input and produces images that look like random noise. 
    With the correct password, the original images can be restored. 
    The encoding format is designed to be robust to some level of JPEG compression.
    This means you can upload Cryptogram images to various social media services and the underlying
    encoded data should not be lost.

    <h2>Why</h2>
    What happens when users upload
    images to social media sites without a full understanding of the privacy settings? Images may be shared inappropriately
    with friends, acquaintances, or strangers. This project provides a way for people to take increased control over the privacy of personal images. Cryptogram
    offers password-level security inside JPEG itself. Encrypted images can be used in a variety of scenarios, including
    websites, social media, or e-mail. But in all cases, password protection is obtained that does not rely on the
    privacy settings or implementation of any particular service provider.

    <h2>Technical</h2>
    
    Image data is converted into base-64 which is then encrypted using AES block cipher, as implemented by <a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/" target=_new>SJCL</a>. The resulting encrypted base-64 data is written to a JPEG with a scheme that uses 2x2 pixel blocks to represent a base-8 number. Base-8 values are represented as shades in the luminance (Y) channel of the YCbCr colorspace. Cryptogram images can withstand JPEG compression down to approximately 70% quality before the decoder starts to fail. As JPEG quality decreases, eventually some base-8 values will become corrupted making decryption impossible.
    
    
    <p>The code is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/prglab/cryptogram" target=_new>GitHub</a>
